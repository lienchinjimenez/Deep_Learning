# Deep Learning Project
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This project was completed in two weeks and involves creating a deep learning model that classifies chest X-ray images of pediatric patients aged one to five from Women and Children's Medical Center in Guangzhou, Guangzhou into two categories: Pneumonia/Normal. The dataset is organized into two folders (train, test) and contains subfolders for each image category. Before using the images to train the AI system, two expert physicians rated the diagnoses to ensure data quality. It was required to achieve an accuracy rate of over 60% using different types of neural networks. It's important to note that the model may take a long time to train, so patience is recommended, as well as being cautious with the selected number of epochs.
